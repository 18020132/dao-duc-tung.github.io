<p>The table below shows five major problems and the differences between ML systems in research and production.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ml-skills/the-ultimate-machine-learning-system/ml-in-production/conflict.jpg" alt="conflict"></p>
<p>In academia, the objective of an ML system usually is model performance. Researchers want to achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. Models often are too complicated to be useful in real-life applications.</p>
<p>Different stakeholders have different objectives. For example, in Facebook, they want to train a model that recommends ads on users&#39; news feed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ML engineers</strong> want that model to predict ads that have a high chance of being clicked by users.</li>
<li><strong>Sales team</strong> wants that model predicts ads that were paid with the highest advertising fee to be shown in the user&#39;s news feed.</li>
<li><strong>Manager</strong> wants to maximize the profit, maybe by sacking somebody.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users won&#39;t see the difference between a model with 98% accuracy and a model with 98.2% accuracy. This 0.2% can save Google millions of dollars.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a simple model can do a reasonable job, complex models must perform significantly better to justify the complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="computational-priority">Computational priority</h3>
<p>In research, we want the training process faster. In production, we want the inference faster.</p>
<p>In research, we want the training process can take as many samples as it can in a second (throughput). In production, latency matters a lot. If you can type your next word faster than what your iPhone predicts, do you ever want to wait and click on the predicted word?</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ml-skills/the-ultimate-machine-learning-system/ml-in-production/data.jpg" alt="data"></p>
<p>In research, data is clean and formatted. They are unchanged so people can use them as benchmarks for evaluation. The process of preparing data and feeding it to your model usually was done by somebody.</p>
<p>In production, data is messy. You have to clean it and re-format it. It&#39;s not easy to split into the training set, test set, or validation set because it usually has some issues like biased, imbalanced, outdated, etc. Sometimes you have to add more label classes or merge two existing label classes. This is really a nightmare!</p>
<p>In research, data usually was created a long time ago. In production, data could be created a long time ago, or streaming data, or both. In production, you need to care about data privacy and regulations.</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Research</th>
<th>Production</th>

<tbody><tr>
<td>Clean</td>
<td>Messy</td>

<tr>
<td>Static</td>
<td>Constantly shifting</td>

<tr>
<td>Mostly historical data</td>
<td>Historical + streaming data</td>

<tr>

<td>Privacy + regulatory concerns</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3 id="fairness">Fairness</h3>
<p>You might be a victim of biased ML algorithms. Your resume might be ranked very low because your name is not common. The ranking model picks name as an important feature :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ML algorithms don&#39;t predict the future, but encode the past, perpetuating the biases in the data and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The minority groups would be harmed badly because the wrong predictions have minor consequences on the model&#39;s overall performance.</p>
<h3 id="interpretability">Interpretability</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ml-skills/the-ultimate-machine-learning-system/ml-in-production/ai-surgeon.jpg" alt="ai-surgeon"></p>
<p>Model interpretability is important to understand why the model makes that prediction/decision. Otherwise, we might feel uncomfortable with trusting it. It also makes the process of debugging, monitoring, and improving the model easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While most of us are comfortable with using a microwave without understanding how it works, many don&#39;t feel the same way about AI yet, especially if that AI makes important decisions about their lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="addons">Addons</h3>
<p>Most companies cannot pursue pure research unless it leads to short-term profitable applications.</p>
<p>Nowadays, more people and organizations in different fields want to find applications for them due to the easy accessibility of state-of-the-art models. That&#39;s why the majority of ML-related jobs are in ML production.</p>
<h2 id="traditional-software-vs-ml-systems">Traditional software vs. ML systems</h2>
<p>ML production would be a much better place if ML experts were better software engineers. Many traditional software engineering tools can be used to develop and deploy ML applications.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ml-skills/the-ultimate-machine-learning-system/ml-in-production/ml-engineering.png" alt="ml-engineering"></p>
<p>However, many challenges are unique to ML applications and require their own tools. Below is the table to compare traditional software and ML systems.</p>

<td>Test and version code &amp; data, models</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Size</td>
<td>Data &amp; code are not too big</td>
<td>Model size might be a challenge</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monitor &amp; debug</td>
<td>A good logging system might be enough</td>

<h2 id="ml-deployment-myths">ML deployment myths</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ml-skills/the-ultimate-machine-learning-system/ml-in-production/myth.jpg" alt="myth"></p>
<p>The table below summarizes some common ML deployment myths.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>#</th>
<th>Myth</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Deploying is hard</td>
<td>Deploying is easy, deploying reliable is hard. Make model available to millions of users with a latency of milliseconds and 99% uptime is hard</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Only deploy one or two ML models at a time</td>
<td>Companies have many ML models. Each different feature of an application requires its own model</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>If we don&#39;t do anything, model performance remains the same</td>
<td>Drift concept: the data your model runs inference on drifts further and further away from the data it was trained on. ML sys performs best right after training</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>No need to update models as much</td>
<td>Since a model performance decays over time, we want to update it as fast as possible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>No need to worry about scale</td>
<td>E.g. a system that serves hundreds of queries per second or millions of users per month</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>ML can transform the business overnight</td>
<td>Magically - possible, but overnight - no. The longer you&#39;ve adopted ML, the faster your development cycle will run, and the higher your Returns On Investment (ROI) will be</td>
</tr>
