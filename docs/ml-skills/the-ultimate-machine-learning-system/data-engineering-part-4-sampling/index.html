<p>In the previous post, we covered how to deal with some data issues and how to perform feature engineering. In this post, we discuss some techniques to sample good training data and some problems related to data sampling.</p>
<h2 id="sampling">Sampling</h2>
<p>Sampling is an essential part of the ML workflow, especially when we don&#39;t have access to all possible data in the real world or have enough computing resources to use all the data for the training process.</p>
<p>There are two types of sampling, including non-probability sampling and random sampling.</p>
<h3 id="non-probability-sampling">Non-probability sampling</h3>
<p>In non-probability sampling, data selection isn&#39;t based on any probability criteria. The result data usually doesn&#39;t represent the real-world data and causes selection bias. There are some common techniques such as.</p>
<ul>
<li>Convenience sampling: samples are selected based on their availability</li>
<li>Snowball sampling: future samples are selected based on the existing samples</li>
<li>Judgement sampling: some experts decide what samples to include</li>
<li>Quota sampling: samples are selected based on quotas for specific slices of data without any randomization</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="random-sampling">Random sampling</h3>
<p><strong>Simple random sampling</strong>: We select equally k% of all examples in this simple method. This method is easy to implement, but the rare classes might not appear in the selection.</p>
<p><strong>Stratified sampling</strong>: This method divides samples into different groups, then selects equally k% from each class. The groups might be gender, category, age, etc. This method cannot handle the case that one sample might belong to multiple groups.</p>
<p><strong>Weighted sampling</strong>: This method gives each sample a weight to be selected. E.g., if recent data is more valuable, we give it a higher weight.</p>
<p><strong>Importance sampling</strong>: This method is common in reinforcement learning.</p>
<p><strong>Reservoir sampling</strong>: This method deals with continually incoming data like streaming data. When a new sample comes, we swap it with a random sample in our <code>N</code>-sample set with the probability of <code>1/N</code>.</p>
<h2 id="data-leakage">Data leakage</h2>
<p>There are two types of data leakage: feature and training data.</p>
<p><strong>Feature leakage</strong>: some form of label <em>leaks</em> into the features.</p>
<p><strong>Training data leakage</strong>: There are some sources that cause this issue, such as.</p>
<ul>
<li>Premature featurization: create a feature on the entire dataset instead of just training data</li>
<li>Oversampling before splits: train splits might contain test samples</li>
<li>Time leakage: randomly splitting data instead of temporal splitting can cause training data to be able to see the future</li>
<li>Group leakage: A patient has 3 CT scans. 2 of them are in the training set, and the last one is in the test set</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solutions</strong>: There are some solutions to fix the data leakage issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check for duplication between train and valid/test splits</li>
<li>Temporal split data, if possible</li>
<li>Use only train splits for feature engineering</li>
<li>Measure correlation between features and labels</li>
<li>Train model on a subset of features. If the model&#39;s performance is very high on a subset, either the features are superb or feature leakage issue.</li>
<li>Monitor the model&#39;s performance as more features are added. If the model&#39;s performance suddenly increases, either the features are superb or a feature leakage issue.</li>
<li>Involve Subject Matter Experts in the feature engineering and sampling processes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="imbalanced-data">Imbalanced data</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ml-skills/the-ultimate-machine-learning-system/data-engineering-part-4-sampling/balance.jpg" alt="balance"></p>
<p>The imbalanced data issue causes some consequences, such as.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient signal: if the number of minority-class samples is low, the problem becomes one of few-shot learning on minority-class samples</li>
<li><em>Satisfactory</em> defaults: by learning from the majority-class samples, the model can obtain low loss and high accuracy while learning relatively little about the underlying structure of the data</li>
<li>Asymmetric cost of error: the human cost of misclassifying a minority class may be asymmetrically great</li>
</ul>
<p>Some sources of error might be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sampling bias: the way the dataset was constructed excludes certain cases</li>
<li>Domain-specific: labels are just very rare given the domain in which the model is operating</li>
<li>Labeling errors: this is less common</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-deal-with-imbalanced-data">How to deal with imbalanced data</h3>
<p>Class imbalance for the binary problem is much easier to deal with than the problems with more than two classes. Some people argue that you shouldn&#39;t fix this issue if that is how the data is in the real world, and a good model should learn to work with that. Despite that argument, we have some techniques to deal with this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Resampling</strong>: add more minority samples or remove majority samples</p>
<ul>
<li>Undersampling: remove the majority of samples. This might cause the loss of important data. E.g., Tomek Links find pairs of samples from opposite classes that are close in proximity and remove the sample of the majority class in each pair</li>
<li>Oversampling: add more minority samples. E.g., SMOTE combines existing minority-class data points linearly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weight balancing</strong>: give higher weight for the wrong prediction in the loss function</p>
<ul>
<li>Biasing toward rare classes: the weight of a class is inversely proportional to the number of samples in that class so that the rarer classes have higher weights</li>
<li>Biasing toward difficult samples: adjust the loss function so that if a sample has a lower probability of being right, it&#39;ll have a higher weight</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ensembles</strong>: choose an algorithm more robust to class imbalance</p>
<ul>
<li>Bagging: reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting</li>
<li>Boosting: converts weak learners to strong ones</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>
<p>This post discussed sampling, data leakage, and imbalanced data. Some sampling methods only work with some problems, some cause the data leakage, and some help us solve the data-imbalanced issue. In production, things are different. For example, we don&#39;t use SMOTE in large-scale applications. To be aware of this, you might need to search for more information about ML system design in production.</p>
