<p><em>Save the best for last</em>.</p>
<p>Today in this post, I will finally reveal the actual interview questions of the <strong>Machine Learning Infrastructure Interview</strong> that I experienced.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t organize the questions in the order of question types such as Coding tests, Computer science fundamentals, System design, MLOps, etc. Instead, I will group them by the interview round types, such as Hard round and Soft round, so you can understand what the question types&#39; distribution looks like in an interview.</p>
<p>All questions are presented in the order of time during the interview. This means for each set of questions, you are seeing the real questions in the actual order in a real interview. Moreover, I will give you instructions to get you through some questions. For the interview tips, please refer to the previous post <strong><a href="../machine-learning-infrastructure-interview-process/">Machine Learning Infrastructure Interview Process</a></strong> in this series.</p>
