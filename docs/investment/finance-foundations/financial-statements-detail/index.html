<h2 id="the-balance-sheet">The balance sheet</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp">The balance sheet</a> shows us the information of the company&#39;s assets, its obligations (its liabilities), and its equities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp">An obligation</a> is the responsibility of a party to meet the terms of a contract or agreement. Individuals, corporations, governments, banks, and institutions—any entity that operates within a society—must regularly fulfill their obligations, or else face punishment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp">A liability</a> is something a person or company owes, usually a sum of money. Recorded on the right side of the balance sheet, liabilities include loans, accounts payable, mortgages, deferred revenues, bonds, warranties, and accrued expenses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/assets/images/investment/finance-foundations/financial-statements-detail/balancesheet.jpg" alt="balancesheet"></p>
<p>Why does the balance sheet show us the liabilities?</p>
<p>Because we do not only want a list of the company&#39;s assets, but also we do want to know where the money came from to buy those assets.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at an example of a balance sheet.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/investment/finance-foundations/financial-statements-detail/balancesheet-ex.jpg" alt="balancesheet-ex"></p>
<ul>
<li>Cash and cash equivalents: cash in all retail stores and bank accounts.</li>
<li>Inventories: the stuff that the company sells to the customer.</li>
<li>Property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E): the company spent that amount of money to buy land, buildings, equipment, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: The total company&#39;s assets on Sept 30th, 2018 was over $350B. Where did the company get the money to buy those assets?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The company can borrow the money, or the shareholder will invest the money.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp">Accounts payable</a>: Debts that must be paid off within a given period to avoid <em>default</em>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp">Default</a> is the failure to repay a debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company made some purchases and hasn&#39;t paid the supplier yet. This is the meaning of accounts payable.</p>
<p>With the inventories of ~$19B and the accounts payable of ~$42B, the company has already sold some inventory for which they haven&#39;t paid for it yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Long-term debt: The company borrowed over $20B on a long-term basis.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp">Earning reinvested</a>: The number of historical profits generated by the company and has been kept in the company for growth purposes like to purchase new assets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-income-statement">The income statement</h2>
<p>The income statement focuses on the company&#39;s revenues and expenses during a particular period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Net income = Revenue - Expense</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s look at this example.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/investment/finance-foundations/financial-statements-detail/income-statement-ex.jpg" alt="income-statement-ex"></p>
<p>The company above has revenue of merchandise sales at about $26k. They use $8k to buy stuff from the supplier (cost of sales). On average, if they sell something that costs $100, they need to spend ~$30 (=8/25.8) to buy it from the supplier.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s net income is $21k. This means if the company sells something that costs $100 after they pay all the expenses, they get ~$70 (=21.35/30.8). This is super profit.</p>
<h2 id="the-cash-flow-statement">The cash flow statement</h2>
<p>The cash flow statement shows the company&#39;s sources and uses of cash over a specified time period and is separated into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating activities</strong>: collect cash from sales, pay cash for rent, utilities, taxes, interest, etc. These are done every day.</li>
<li><strong>Investing activities</strong>: invest in the <strong>productive capacity</strong> of the business. For example, buy/sell new/old buildings, machines, PP&amp;E, long-term investment, etc. These are done occasionally.</li>
<li><strong>Financing activities</strong>: borrow money, manage investment, pay loans, pay dividends, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s look at an example of a cash flow statement from operating activities below.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/investment/finance-foundations/financial-statements-detail/cash-flow-statement-ex.jpg" alt="cash-flow-statement-ex"></p>
<p>The total amount of cash generated by <strong>operating activities</strong> of the company is $39k.
The company will spend this money to maintain or expand the productive capacity (<strong>investing activities</strong>). This is called capital expenditures (CAPEX).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CAPEX: money spent by a business on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings, and equipment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>The key</em> in the cash flow statement is <strong>cash from operating activities</strong>.</p>
<p>Assuming the company spends $20k for CAPEX, the remaining $19k is called <strong>free cash flow</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Free cash flow</strong> (FCF) is the cash that the company is free to use. Free cash flow represents a company&#39;s financial flexibility.</p>
<p>The company can use this FCF to pay for the debt, pay dividends to shareholders, buy back shares of stock from shareholders, etc (<strong>financing activities</strong>).</p>
