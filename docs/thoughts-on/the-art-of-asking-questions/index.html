<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>Recently, I&#39;ve moved to a new team, the big team that I&#39;ve ever worked with. And of course, lots of meetings.</p>
<p><em>Fortunately</em>, I&#39;m the youngest engineer in the team, so I have fewer meetings than higher-level engineers to do my coding stuff.</p>
<p>Wait a sec, should I use &quot;<em>Unfortunately</em>&quot; instead?</p>
<p>Meetings are organized to make people working more efficiently, to work together and to win together, not to let people feel like they are wasting their time.</p>
<p>There are definitely some certain disadvantages of meetings. But on the other side, I personally choose to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>In a meeting, I can practice communicating efficiently, training good explanation skills, and asking better questions.</p>
<p>In a project-specific meeting, my boss knows how to make the right questions. He asks questions that help me to figure out what my REAL challenge is. He asks questions to let me solve it myself, not solve it himself by giving advice.</p>
<p>A little more asking people questions, a little less telling people what to do.</p>
<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>
<p>A good question I found yesterday: &quot;And what else?&quot;.</p>
<p>When people are talking about their stuff, even when they stop talking for a while, don&#39;t ask rhetorical questions, advice-giving questions like &quot;Have you thought of ...?&quot;, &quot;What about ...?&quot;, &quot;Did you consider ...?&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead, ask them &quot;And what else?&quot; or sort of. I usually see they come up with the very idea similar to what I&#39;m going to &quot;suggest&quot;.</p>
<p>Stop showing off, telling people about my brilliant ideas before they share their ones.</p>
<p>Stop taking control, acting like I know the rest, and wrapping up the conversation.</p>
<p>This is not humility, this is the art.</p>
<p>Scientifically, this question helps people to achieve a higher level of thinking, deepen their understanding of problems, and promote collaboration.</p>
<p>To be continued...</p>
