<blockquote>
<p>Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the <em>blah blah blah</em>. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Wikiperdia</a>)</p>

<p>Let&#39;s forget what you have read and start with <strong>AI Engineer</strong>&#39;s introduction.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="why-docker">Why docker?</h3>
<p>Have you set up a development environment for your deep learning project?</p>
<p>Have you ever had trouble with TensorFlow when you have to install a compatible version for a project that you clone from somewhere and you already installed another version of TensorFlow on your PC?</p>
<p>Even if you just want to start a Jupyter notebook, you need to install it on your PC. Or you might use Anaconda to install it. But again, you need to decide which version of Anaconda you want to use, and whether the Anaconda Python get conflict with your native Python is another story. By doing these things, you will possibly mess up your operating system (OS) by installing and uninstalling tools around.</p>
<p>Docker will let you install whatever the version of the libraries you need into your OS without messing it!</p>
<h3 id="how">How?</h3>
<p>Docker splits <strong>a Linux system</strong> into smaller worlds called <strong>containers</strong>.</p>
<p>Containers are isolated from one another. A container has everything needed to run your code such as your code, configuration files, your tools, networking system and just enough of the operating system to run your code.</p>
<p>When the containers were born by you, they can&#39;t see each other. You will configure them to let them chit chat around.</p>
