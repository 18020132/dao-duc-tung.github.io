title: About
---

I'm an engineer who loves getting hands-on with different parts of an ML system like Project Scoping, Data Management, Model Development, Deployment, Monitoring, Maintenance, and Business Analysis.

I also like talking about the intersection of technology, health, life, and musical instruments.

I believe that learning is a lifetime journey, and my interests will be the rocket fuel to lead me along the way.

If I were the last person on Earth, I would still make my art.
