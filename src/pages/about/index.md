My name is Tung.

I'm a Software Engineer who is trying to become another type of engineer like Machine Learning Engineer or Data Engineer or something like that.

I love coding, musical instruments, and self-learning. Currently, I'm practicing planche.

I'm writing this blog for sharing what I learn because famous and wise persons usually do that.

Last but not least, I choose this [aiengineer.net](https://aiengineer.net/) domain because it's cheap.
