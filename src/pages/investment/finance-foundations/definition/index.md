What is the definition of **finance**?

**Finance** includes 3 activities. Each activity is determined by a question:

- What things do the company needs to buy?
- Where to get the money to buy those things?
- How to manage them efficiently once the company bought them?

## What things do the company needs to buy?

This question is to define the requirements to achieve the company's goals.
The requirements can be long-term or short-term.

In a more simple explanation, the company needs to define what _big_ things and _small_ things they need to buy.

- Big things (long-term): buy a new building, machines, etc.
- Small things (short-term): buy new products for inventory, hire data scientists for research, expand marketing team, etc.

Of course, all of those things are not either big or small. It's just a way of explanation.

## Where to get the money to buy those things?

The company can get the money from different sources such as:

- Shareholders, investors
- Borrow from the bank
- Or get the money from company internal profit

The board of directors needs to decide where to get the money.
This is usually what people implicitly understand when they talk about finance.

## How to manage them efficiently?

This is the problem of management.
The company needs to _schedule_ and _spend company resources_ like machines
or staff to _manage_, _control_, _process_, _use_ them efficiently.
