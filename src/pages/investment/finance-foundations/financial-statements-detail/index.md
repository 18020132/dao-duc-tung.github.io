## The balance sheet

[The balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) shows us the information of company's assets, its liabilities, and its equities.

> [An obligation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp) is the responsibility of a party to meet the terms of a contract or agreement. Individuals, corporations, governments, banks, and institutions—any entity that operates within a society—must regularly fulfill their obligations, or else face punishment.

> [A liability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp) is something a person or company owes, usually a sum of money. Recorded on the right side of the balance sheet, liabilities include loans, accounts payable, mortgages, deferred revenues, bonds, warranties, and accrued expenses.

> Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Why does the balance sheet show us the liabilities?

Because we do not only want a list of company's assets, but also we do want to know where the money came from to buy those assets.

Let's look at an example of balance sheet.

![balancesheet-ex][balancesheet-ex]

- Cash and cash equivalents: cash in all retail stores and bank accounts.
- Inventories: the stuff that the company sells to the customer.
- Property, plant and equipment (PP&E): the company spent that amount of money to buy land, buildings, equipments, etc.

**Question**: The total company's assets on Sept 30th 2018 was over $350,000M. Where did the company get the money to buy those assets?

**Answer**: The company can borrow the money, or the shareholder will invest the money.

- [Accounts payable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp): Debts that must be paid off within a given period to avoid _default_.

> [Default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) is the failure to repay a debt.

The company made some purchases and haven't paid the supplier yet. This is the meaning of accounts payable.

With the inventories of ~$19,000M and the accounts payable of ~$42,000M, the company has already sold some inventory for which they haven't paid for yet.

- Long-term debt: The company borrowed over $20,000M on a long-term basis.
- [Earning reinvested](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp): The amount of historical profits generated by the company and has been kept in the company for growth purpose like to purchase new assets.
