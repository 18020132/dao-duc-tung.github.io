In this post, we will take a look on six common key financial ratios including:

- Debt ratio
- Current ratio
- Return on sales ratio
- Asset turnover ratio
- Return on equity ratio
- Price earnings ratio

## Debt ratio

> Debt ratio = total debt (liabilities) / total assets

[Debt ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtratio.asp) measures the extent of a company's _leverage_.

> Leverage compares Borrowed money vs. Investment from owners/shareholders

Let's look at an example of balance sheet from the previous post about Financial Statements.

![balancesheet-ex][balancesheet-ex]

This balance sheet reports the company's total assets of ~$350B and the company's total liabilities of ~$160B. Using the formula above, the debt ratio is ~45%. The rest ~55% was invested by shareholders.

Debt ratio can be interpreted as the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt.

A high ratio indicates that a company may be putting itself at risk of default on its loans if interest rates were to rise suddenly.

Debt ratios vary widely across industries, with capital-intensive businesses such as utilities and pipelines having much higher debt ratios than other industries such as the technology or services sector.

**NOTE**: The average debt ratio for the large companies is 50-60%.

## Current ratio

[Current ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp) measures a company's ability to pay **short-term** obligations or those due within one year.

> Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities

> Current assets = cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets (OCA) that are expected to be liquidated or turned into cash in the next year.

> Current liabilities = accounts payable, wages, taxes payable, short-term debts, and the current portion of long-term debt that are expected to be paid in the next year.

> Accounts receivable and accounts payable are essentially opposites. Accounts payable is the money a company owes its vendors, while accounts receivable is the money that is owed to the company, typically by customers.

The current ratio of Exxon Mobil corp in the example above is \~$350B / \~$160B= \~2.2.

A current ratio of less than one may seem alarming, although different situations can affect the current ratio in a solid company. For example, a normal monthly cycle for the company’s collections and payment processes may lead to a high current ratio as payments are received, but a low current ratio as those collections downgrade.
