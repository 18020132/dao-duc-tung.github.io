Every quarter, **the board of directors** of a company will have a strategic meeting to talk about **finance**.

> The board of directors = an elected group of individuals that represent **shareholders**.

> Shareholders = company partners = any person, company, or institution that owns at least 1 share of a company's stock.

They will talk about:

- **Inventory management**: to order, store and use company's inventory more efficiently.

- **Acquisitions**: to expand the company by buying other companies.

- **Borrowing policy**: to facilitate the process of borrowing the money. They might use a line of credit with a bank.

> A line of credit = a pre-approved loan with a limit from a financial institution.

- **Share buybacks**: to decide whether they should buy stock back or not from shareholders.

- **Large institutions**: to find out who is buying the company shares from shareholders. They might be insurance companies, mutual funds, etc.

This is finance.
