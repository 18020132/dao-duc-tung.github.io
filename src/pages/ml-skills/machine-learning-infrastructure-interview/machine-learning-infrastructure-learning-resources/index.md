In this post, I will share a comprehensive list of the learning sources that you might need to study before your interview. The actual interview questions that I was asked will be shared in the next post.

The learning resources that you will see in this post are the resources I have been learning for years. You might not find any other detailed list dedicated to machine learning infrastructure interviews like this anywhere else.
