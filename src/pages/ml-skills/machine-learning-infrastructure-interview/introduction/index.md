In this series of **Machine Learning Infrastructure Interview**, I will share with you my journey of learning and pursuing **Machine Learning Systems** as a career path from the very beginning level to the Senior level.

**Machine Learning Infrastructure** is a part of a **Machine Learning System**. In my humble opinion, Machine Learning System is still a developing area and it's very potential. There are many opportunities and many challenges when building a Machine Learning System that people are trying to solve. However, in this **Machine Learning Infrastructure Interview** series, we will not discuss what a Machine Learning System is or what challenges Machine Learning Systems are facing. For those topics, please refer to my other series **The Ultimate Machine Learning System**.

For the **Machine Learning System Interview**, I recommend you to read this book [Machine Learning Design Interview](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZKJSKZ1). This book covers the **Machine Learning System Design Interview** at big tech companies like _FAANG_. My **Machine Learning Infrastructure Interview** series focuses more on the interview process and interview questions of the **Machine Learning Infrastructure**, **Machine Learning Platform**, and **MLOps** roles.

Generally, after going through this **Machine Learning Infrastructure Interview** series, you will have an overview of what knowledge you might need to learn, what tools and technologies you might need to know, and which topics you should practice for the **Machine Learning Infrastructure Interview**, what tips and tricks you might need to increase the chance of being offered, and the most important thing, how the real **Machine Learning Infrastructure Interview** questions look like.

I'll see you my reader in the next post.
