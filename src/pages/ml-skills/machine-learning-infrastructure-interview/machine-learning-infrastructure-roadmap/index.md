Today in this post, I will share with you my journey from when I was a student until the time I fell in love with Machine Learning Infrastructure.

## My journey

The first time I heard about _machine learning_ was when I was a fourth-year student at my university, and I didn't even search on Google to see what it meant. In the same year, 2016, I had a subject named _Computer Vision_ which I don't even know why I had to learn. After finishing the subject, I realized something had changed in my mind.

In my fifth year at university in 2017, I got a chance to work on a big Computer Vision project as a researcher with a famous professor. After graduation in 2018, I continued doing research on Computer Vision with my professor for one year.

From 2019 to 2020, I was diving into the world of Computer Vision. During this time, I also worked for some companies where I had chances to learn about software architecture and to design and implement several software core applications from the very beginning to the end products. At that time, I tried to deliver the products as perfectly as possible. I didn't know that my software architecture design experience helped me a lot in terms of systematized thinking when it came to Machine Learning Infrastructure or Machine Learning Systems Design later on.

At the beginning of 2021, I started learning about machine learning system design. I learned it by taking online courses, reading tutorial articles, searching for best practices, and building my own machine learning systems. I was fortunate that I could also apply what I learned to what I was doing at my company. Moreover, I volunteered for a community project as an MLOps engineer. This was really the moment when my experience was boosted like a rocket.

That is a brief description of my career so far. In short, I want to emphasize two things in my journey: machine learning knowledge is crucial, and software architecture is essential to shape my mindset into a systematic structure.

## The roadmap

Instead of giving you a comprehensive list of things that you might get overwhelmed with, I will provide you with a list of topics that you might need in order to become a Senior in the Machine Learning Systems area.

- Machine learning
- Software architecture
- Software testing
- Cloud architecture
- DevOps
- System design
- Machine learning system design

Please take note that some of the topics above can be grouped into one line, but I intended to separate them into multiple lines to highlight their importance.

During the learning journey, remember that no one can learn those topics once and master them one by one in months. It should take years. You usually work on problems that belong to a small subset of the topics most of the time. At the end of the day, you at least may aggregate things to build a small system, and you move forward from there. Eventually, you will know how the _dots_ are connected.
