Today, ML is present in almost every aspect of our lives, from how we access information, communicate, and work, to how we find the love of our lives. More and more companies are using ML as the solution to their most difficult problems.

However, when many people hear about ML systems, they immediately think of ML algorithms such as classification, regression, or other types of neural networks. ML algorithms are only a small part of the ML system. An ML system includes the user interface, data, hardware to run the system, and infrastructure that allows the system to be developed, deployed, monitored, and updated.

In research, people are usually only interested in ML algorithms, but in production, they need to care about all the components of an ML system. And because there are different interests in the research environment and the production environment, the ML positions are also different in these two environments.

In this **Machine Learning roles** topic, we will talk about the difference of ML in research and in production. Then we will talk about the locations of ML in these two environments.
