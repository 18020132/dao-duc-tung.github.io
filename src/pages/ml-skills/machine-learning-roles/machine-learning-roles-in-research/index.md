3.1. Research scientist
The role of a research scientist is to come up with original, novel, and innovative ideas. This position usually requires a Ph. and/or first-place papers at leading conferences in the world in the ML industry.
3.2. Applied research scientist
Applied research lies between research and production, but closer to research than production. Applied research involves finding solutions to real-world problems, but not implementing those solutions in a real-world environment, and they need expertise in these problems.
3.3. Research engineer
This is a rare position, often found in large research laboratories. The role of a research engineer is to use their engineering skills to set up and run tests from research scientists.
