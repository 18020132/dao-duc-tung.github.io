4.2.1. Product owner
Responsibilities: Define goals and vision for ML . projects
Skills: Strategic vision, leadership, project management skills, subject matter expertise at work, stock examples, and a high-level understanding of ML to know what ML can be and cannot be resolved.
Also need to be in team research projects but usually still researchers.
4.2.2. Product manager
Responsibilities: Ensure the ML project meets the set goals, timelines and technical requirements
Skills: project management skills, leadership ability, expertise on the subject at hand, high-level understanding of ML, knowledge of ML systems.
Also need to be in team research projects but usually still researchers.
4.2.3. Data scientist/Data analyst
Responsibilities: Use methods, processes, and algorithms to generate business insights from data.
Skills: deep math knowledge, statistical probabilities, real-world problem expertise (stocks) to apply ML to those problems, ML knowledge to interpret model output and behavior .

4.3.1. Data engineer
Responsibilities: Build data pipeline, aggregate data, store data, monitor data
Skills: using database, data management tools to know how to store/retrieve/process data, skills to deploy distributed systems to handle big data, minimal ML knowledge for optimization Efficient way to store data for ML applications.

4.4.1. ML engineer
Responsibilities: Train and deploy ML models
Skills: requires knowledge of probability statistics, ML to understand data and evaluate models, and requires software engineering skills to write effective code, especially in data structures and algorithms.

Since this position requires simultaneous skills in ML and Software engineering, it is quite difficult to recruit. In fact, some hiring managers have said that they want to hire good engineers but don't know much about ML because it's easier for good engineers to learn ML than when ML professionals learn the techniques. engineering by engineer.

4.4.2. ML engineer vs. data scientist
MLEs probably spend most of their time working on data during model training, and so can data scientists. However, there are many differences between ML engineering and data science.
The goal of a data scientist is to generate business insights about the business, while the goal of an ML engineer is to turn data into products.
Data scientists tend to be better probabilities and MLEs tend to be better engineers.
MLEs definitely need to know ML algorithms, while many data scientists can do their job without touching ML.

4.5.1. MLOps engineer
Responsibilities: Deploy and oversee the ML system in production
Skills: Mainly techniques from standard Software engineering

As we know, the responsibility of MLE also includes deploying the ML model.
However, MLE focuses on writing code to run prediction
MLOps engineer focuses on the system part, the techniques used to automate the process of deploying MLE's code prediction to the production environment.
When the ML system or when the project is small, the MLE will usually take the position and responsibilities of an MLOps engineer.
