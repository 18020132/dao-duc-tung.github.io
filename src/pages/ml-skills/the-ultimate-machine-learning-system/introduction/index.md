This series of **The Ultimate Machine Learning System** will cover the key concepts, the common techniques, and the common tools for designing and developing a Machine Learning system from **Problem Definition**, **Data Engineering**, **Model Development** to **Deployment**.

This series is intended for ML practitioners with at least one year of experience working with ML and should:

- Be able to express the intuition behind basic ML algorithms and perform basic hyperparameter optimization
- Understand the ML pipeline and its components
- Experience with ML and deep learning frameworks
- Understand and experience in model training, deployment, and operational best practices

Please take note that not all audiences are suitable for all the posts in this series. Some posts will target the business decision-makers, and some will target ML Engineers or Data Scientists. I write this series for people like me at this time who are engineers for now, and in the transition to a higher responsibility position.
