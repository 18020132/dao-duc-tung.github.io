In this topic, I will share with you the key notes of the [Machine Learning Systems Design course](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/index.html) organized by **Standford University**, and what I experienced in real-world projects.

The topic will cover key concepts of a ML system as below:

- ML production, ML challenges and ML deployment myths
- ML system goals, ML iterative process, ML adoption
- Data engineering, Batch processing vs. Stream processing, ML pipelines
- Data sampling, data augmentation, feature engineering, data leakage, model selection
- AutoML, model calibration, model evalution, data testing, model testing, pipeline testing
- ML workflow management, data versioning, model versioning
- Model compression, containerized deployment, test in production
- Model training to fulfill fairness, robustness, and interpretability
- Monitoring and maintenence

I also summarized this course by highlighting key things. You can check out [This Board](https://whimsical.com/cs-329s-machine-learning-systems-design-note-E7oPi8C6VUU89j8yPJdgzK@2Ux7TurymLxaSgJ7VvRt).
