Today in this post, I will share with you my journey from when I was a student until the time I have been falling in love with Machine Learning Systems.

<toc>

## My journey

The first time that I heard about _machine learning_ is when I was a fourth-year student at my university, and I didn't even want to search on Google to see what it means. In the same year 2016, I had a subject named _Computer Vision_ which I don't even know why I had to learn. After finishing the subject, I realized something changed in my mind.

In my fifth year in 2017, I got a chance to work on a big Computer Vision project with a professor as a researcher. After graduation in 2018, I continued doing research on Computer Vision with my professor for one year.

From 2019 to 2020, I was diving into the world of Computer Vision. During this time, I also worked for some companies where I had a chance to learn about software architecture, and to design and implement several software applications from the very beginning to the end products. At that time I was just trying to deliver the products as perfectly as I can. I didn't know that my software architecture design experience helped me a lot when it comes to Machine Learning Systems later on in recent years.

In the entire year 2021, I started learning about machine learning system design. I just learned it myself by taking online courses, reading tutorial articles, searching for best practices, and building my own machine learning systems. I was very lucky in the sense that I could also apply what I learned to what I was doing at my company. Moreover, I volunteered for a community project as an MLOps engineer. This was really the moment when my experience was boosted like a rocket.

That is a short description of my career so far. I'm still considered a young engineer, so please don't expect a few pages of experience here. The thing I want to emphasize about my journey from a student to a Senior in the machine learning system design area is that machine learning knowledge is crucial, and software architecture is crucial to shaping my mindset into a systematic structure.

## Machine learning system roadmap

Instead of giving you a comprehensive list of things that you might get overwhelmed with, I will give you a list of topics that you might need to get familiar with.

- Machine learning
- Software architecture
- Software testing
- Cloud architecture
- DevOps
- System design
- Machine learning system design

Please take note that some of the topics above can be grouped into one line, but I intended to separate them to highlight their importance.

During the learning journey, remember that no one can learn those topics once and master them one by one. Most of the time we work on problems that belong to a small subset of the topics. At the end of the day, we at least may aggregate things to build a small system, and we move forward from there. Eventually, you will know how the _dots_ are connected.
