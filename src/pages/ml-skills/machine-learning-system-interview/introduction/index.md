In this series of **Machine Learning System Interview**, I will share with you my journey of learning and pursuing Machine Learning Systems as a career path from the very beginning level to the Senior level.

This **Machine Learning System Interview** series does not only cover the interviews for the **Machine Learning System** role, but also **Machine Learning Infrastructure**, **Machine Learning Platform**, and **MLOps** roles.

In my humble opinion, Machine Learning System is still a developing area. There are many opportunities and many known challenges when building a Machine Learning System that people are trying to solve. However, in this **Machine Learning System Interview** series, we will not discuss what is a Machine Learning System or what challenges Machine Learning Systems are facing.

Generally, after going through this **Machine Learning System Interview** series, you will have an overview of what knowledge you might need to learn, what tools and technologies you might need to know, and which topics you should practice for the Machine Learning System Interview, what tips and tricks you might need to improve the chance of being offered, and the most important thing, how the real Machine Learning System interview questions look like.

I'll see you my reader in the next post.
