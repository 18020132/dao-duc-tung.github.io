## The balance sheet

[The balance sheet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp) shows us the information of the company's assets, its obligations (its liabilities), and its equities.

> [An obligation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp) is the responsibility of a party to meet the terms of a contract or agreement. Individuals, corporations, governments, banks, and institutions—any entity that operates within a society—must regularly fulfill their obligations, or else face punishment.

> [A liability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp) is something a person or company owes, usually a sum of money. Recorded on the right side of the balance sheet, liabilities include loans, accounts payable, mortgages, deferred revenues, bonds, warranties, and accrued expenses.

> Assets = Liabilities + Equity

![balancesheet][balancesheet]

Why does the balance sheet show us the liabilities?

Because we do not only want a list of the company's assets, but also we do want to know where the money came from to buy those assets.

Let's look at an example of a balance sheet.

![balancesheet-ex][balancesheet-ex]

- Cash and cash equivalents: cash in all retail stores and bank accounts.
- Inventories: the stuff that the company sells to the customer.
- Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E): the company spent that amount of money to buy land, buildings, equipment, etc.

**Question**: The total company's assets on Sept 30th, 2018 was over $350B. Where did the company get the money to buy those assets?

**Answer**: The company can borrow the money, or the shareholder will invest the money.

- [Accounts payable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp): Debts that must be paid off within a given period to avoid _default_.

> [Default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) is the failure to repay a debt.

The company made some purchases and hasn't paid the supplier yet. This is the meaning of accounts payable.

With the inventories of ~$19B and the accounts payable of ~$42B, the company has already sold some inventory for which they haven't paid for it yet.

- Long-term debt: The company borrowed over $20B on a long-term basis.
- [Earning reinvested](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp): The number of historical profits generated by the company and has been kept in the company for growth purposes like to purchase new assets.

## The income statement

The income statement focuses on the company's revenues and expenses during a particular period.

> Net income = Revenue - Expense

Let's look at this example.

![income-statement-ex][income-statement-ex]

The company above has revenue of merchandise sales at about $26k. They use $8k to buy stuff from the supplier (cost of sales). On average, if they sell something that costs $100, they need to spend ~$30 (=8/25.8) to buy it from the supplier.

The company's net income is $21k. This means if the company sells something that costs $100 after they pay all the expenses, they get ~$70 (=21.35/30.8). This is super profit.

## The cash flow statement

The cash flow statement shows the company's sources and uses of cash over a specified time period and is separated into three categories:

- **Operating activities**: collect cash from sales, pay cash for rent, utilities, taxes, interest, etc. These are done every day.
- **Investing activities**: invest in the **productive capacity** of the business. For example, buy/sell new/old buildings, machines, PP&E, long-term investment, etc. These are done occasionally.
- **Financing activities**: borrow money, manage investment, pay loans, pay dividends, etc.

Let's look at an example of a cash flow statement from operating activities below.

![cash-flow-statement-ex][cash-flow-statement-ex]

The total amount of cash generated by **operating activities** of the company is $39k.
The company will spend this money to maintain or expand the productive capacity (**investing activities**). This is called capital expenditures (CAPEX).

> CAPEX: money spent by a business on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings, and equipment.

**NOTE**: _The key_ in the cash flow statement is **cash from operating activities**.

Assuming the company spends $20k for CAPEX, the remaining $19k is called **free cash flow**.

**Free cash flow** (FCF) is the cash that the company is free to use. Free cash flow represents a company's financial flexibility.

The company can use this FCF to pay for the debt, pay dividends to shareholders, buy back shares of stock from shareholders, etc (**financing activities**).
