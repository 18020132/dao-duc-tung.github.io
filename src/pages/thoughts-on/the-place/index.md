## Thoughts

A place to work or live like Hanoi or Singapore is .. just a place.

One of my friends is originally from Hanoi. In Hanoi, he has his family, friends, relationships, work. He chose to move to Singapore because he doesn't have the opportunity to develop his career and live the way he wants in Hanoi. The advantages that people see turn out to be the barriers making him afraid and not daring to pursue other things more suitable for his personality.

Sometimes, we have to learn to let go of our advantages, relationships, knowledge, and even money. Hanoi gives me the feeling that everything is under control. But in 2017, I still decided to leave it.

## Discovery

There are things that we have to let go before we know if they are really important. Giving up something gives us a chance to reevaluate if it's really necessary for our life. The house, the wardrobe, or the bed, are things that I realize are not as important as I thought. But there are some books, a pen, and a working desk which are more important than those things.

After a few years of leaving Hanoi, I choose to go back.
