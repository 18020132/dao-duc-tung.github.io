## Thoughts

I am a lucky person.

16 years old - I experienced love and loss.
24 years old - I achieved one of the biggest targets of my life.
26 years old - I found out my passion.

Ironically, despite having time, health, money, I have not been too excited about them. I want to travel. I want to buy sparkling things. I want to have interesting experiences. But as a minimalist, I don't do what I want. I only follow what I need.

I need air to breathe.

I need water to drink.

I need to eat to survive.

## Discovery

It might be a little bit too much of "I", isn't it? This life is not only for myself but also for many other people who are not as lucky as me.
I do think that what we need to do is not to take anything more, but to give what we have.

For the past few years, in the roles of a mentor and a teacher, I have organized classes to teach people guitar, English, computer programming, and artificial intelligence.

I need to eat, drink and breathe to survive, but I need you to live and give.

No matter how good, rich, or free I am, just being alone is never enough. There are many people in different circumstances needing help from us to rise in life. I do believe that they will do the same for the next generations.
