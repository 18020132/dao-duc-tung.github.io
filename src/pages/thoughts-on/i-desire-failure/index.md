## Thoughts

At 20, I failed the first interview for an intern position in a tech corp.

At 21, I failed the second interview for another intern position in another tech corp.

At 22, I failed the third interview for an exchange scholarship to Sejong University in Korea.

Those first failures are the motivation helping me to be more mature and confident to achieve more.

At 23, I got an exchange scholarship to Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

At 24, I started my first dream job in Singapore.

At 25, I started my second dream job in a tech company in Singapore.

At 26, I saved my first 1 billion VND.

At 27, I have started my third dream job in a world-top-7-in-revenue tech company. I have found a burning passion. And I have a harmonious family.

## Discovery

But the more successful I achieved, the more scared I felt. Fear of losing what I have, fear of becoming arrogant and selfish. I feared failure. But the lack of failure was freaking me out.

What do I need to do?

Instead of hiding, I decided to face it. Exposing myself more, dreaming bigger, choosing higher and more risky goals. I am currently willing to sacrifice what I have, to achieve better things. The fear gradually disappears and hope appears.

Anyone at any time has some kind of fear. But instead of avoiding them, let them follow and haunt us. Giving ourselves a chance to face them. So that when we look back, we won't regret the things we have not done, but we will be proud of what we have done.
