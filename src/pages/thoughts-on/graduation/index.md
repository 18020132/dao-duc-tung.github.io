![graduation][graduation]

After more than 18 years of schooling, on the official graduation day, looking back on the journey, it was short but full of emotions, bewilderment, fear, and infatuated.

During that time, I always believed in "Follow your passion, success will follow you", and "when we have found our passion in life, everything after that will be very easy".

But life is not simple. When I graduated from school, the feelings of anxiety and pressure from family and society were heavier than I ever thought. When I realized that my passion couldn't sustain me, I started to fear.

I was afraid that I was wrong.

Fear of letting my parents be disappointed.

Or just afraid of poor, lonely life.

BUT just as failure is the mother of success, there is no courage that is not born from fear.

Batman is afraid of bats.

Dad is afraid of mom.

And I'm afraid of becoming someone's copy.

From one of Steve Job's quotes that I don't remember exactly, it doesn't mean turning passion into work. The real meaning is that we can pursue anything. Success, in terms of money, status, or fame, is just a resource for us to pursue that "anything". Success is not a destination, it's a journey for us to achieve our own dreams.

The courage here is not only daring to pursue a dream, but also daring to do everything, without caring about arduous, tired, or lowly, to be able to achieve that dream.

We are young, we have time, but not because of that we can relax. We are all the same in one keyway. We each only get 24 hours per day. Nobody gets more, nobody gets less.

What makes life meaningful is that it doesn't last forever. It is precious because it will come to an end. The time we have is a gift. Don't waste our time living someone else's life. Finding, chasing, and fighting for our dreams. Making them recognized. Finding ways to achieve them. Even if we fail, we will still continue trying our best, and success will come.
