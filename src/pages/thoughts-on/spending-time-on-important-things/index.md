## Thought 1

Several years ago, I was not so good with English. I didn't like it. I misunderstood unfamiliarity as dislike.

## Thought 2

I've met a lot of people. The most successful and happiest people I've ever known are the ones who know how to spend their time for career, family, and things they consider important. At first, I didn't understand why they didn't just make more money? I thought they must have lots of free time. And if they didn't have lots of money, they wouldn't care about those "fancy" things.

But no, they are very busy.

It's just that they try to spend as much time as possible on the most important things, to make time for the things that matter.

## Thought 3

Even if you are undervalued, belittled, even taken advantage of, even if you fail, even if it takes time to do what you are doing, even if it hurts to do it, there are things worth doing.

Because this is the reason for living.

## Question

What things are important to you?
